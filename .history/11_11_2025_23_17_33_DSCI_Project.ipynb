    "2. Assumptions include:\n",
    "   - Categorical values are independent (beginner and pro are two independent variables)\n",
    "   - Scaling is reasonable (Age has much larger scale than other quanlitative variables)\n",
    "   - Balanced data distribution\n",
    "   - The closer the points, the more related\n",
    "3. Limitations include:\n",
    "   - Fail to predict out of range values\n",
    "   - Outliers may dominate the predicting result\n",
    "   - Categorical values like types in `experience` may be correlated\n",
    "4. I select the model based on the results of cross validation. More specifically, lower RMSPE on validation data, better the model.\n",
    "5. Quanlitative variables are turned into 0s and 1s, where as Age is centered and scaled within standard deviation of 1. Moreover, with a random seed, I will split the data with prop = 0.8, where the greater part goes to training and the other testing. I will find the best k value by selecting k from 5, 7, ..., 21. I will also do 5-fold cross validation to find the best trained model."
