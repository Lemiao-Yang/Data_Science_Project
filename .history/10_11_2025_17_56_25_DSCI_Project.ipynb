    "A real data science project from a UBC research group is researching how people play video games through recording players' actions when playing on a MineCraft server. However, due to limited resources, the study requires a narrower recruitment team of players that would provide them a greater amount of data. Hence, this page investigate in the narrower scope; more specifically, investigate traits players obtain that are most likely to contribute a large amount of data.\n",
